<div>Birds - bullfinch - Chickadees, nuthatches, some woodpeckers, jays, and crows store, or 
	“cache,” food. Many other feeder birds—doves, sparrows, blackbirds, finches, 
	etc.—do not store food at all.&nbsp;Those that do store food may hide hundreds, 
	or even thousands, of seeds every year.</div>
